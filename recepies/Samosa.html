    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Crispy, flaky Samosa is the perfect appetizer for any celebration. Filled
      with a spicy potato filling, this Samosa is also vegan!
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
      <h3>Spices</h3>
      <p>
        The spices marked with an asterisk* are speciality spices that likely
        require a trip to an Indian grocery store. But I’ve made notes for best
        substitutions!
      </p>
      <li>
        Ajwain seeds* – An Indian spice with a fragrant and fruity but bitter
        taste. Substitute thyme leaves;
      </li>
      <li>
        Amchur* – Also known as mango powder, is made from dried green mangoes.
        It is sour in taste and is said to help digestion. Substitute 1/2 tsp
        lemon juice;
      </li>
      <li>
        Asafoetida* – Also known as hing, this is a traditional ingredient used
        in Indian cooking that is derived from a species of giant fennel. It has
        a somewhat bitter garlic / onion flavour, which makes it a great
        substitute for people who can’t have garlic or onion.! Substitute 1/4
        tsp each of garlic and onion powder;
      </li>
      <li>
        Black mustard seeds – They look like poppyseeds but are fragrant and
        have a slight horseradish-like bite to them. They’re not spicy, more a
        fresh zing. ~ $1.50 in small packs at Indian grocery stores. Also sold
        in the Indian food section at some Woolworths (Australia) $1.70, and
        online! Also used in Eggplant Curry, Dal and Vegetable Samosa Pie
        recipes;
      </li>
      <li>
        Garam Masala – A well-known Indian spice mix which is pretty common
        these days. It’s found in the spice aisle of regular supermarkets and
        costs not more than other spices; and
      </li>
      <li>
        Cumin seeds and powder, coriander seeds and turmeric – Very common
        spices used in Indian cooking, found everywhere these days at regular
        grocery stores.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
      <h3>The other Ingredients</h3>
      <li>Flour – Just regular all purpose/plain flour</li>
      <li>
        Green chilli – Use a cayenne pepper which provides just a mild
        background hum of spice. These Samosas are not overly spicy!
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Ghee or oil – Ghee is a traditional cooking fat used in Indian
          cooking. It is simply normal butter but with milk solids and water
          removed, leaving behind pure butter fat. Ghee has a more intense
          butter flavour than normal butter, with the added bonus that unlike
          butter, it doesn’t burn even on high heat.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is rubbed into the flour to make the Samosa pastry flaky. You can
          either make your own Ghee (it’s cheaper, really easy and keeps for
          months), buy it, or just use normal butter;
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        Potatoes – For the potato filling. Use either starchy or all-rounder
        potatoes, such as Sebago (Australia brushed “dirt” potatoes), Russet,
        Yukon Gold or Idahos (US), Maris Piper or King Edwards (UK);
      </li>
      <li>
        Ginger – Fresh ginger is best here, but you could substitute with ginger
        powder in an emergency 😇;
      </li>
      <li>Peas – Frozen all the way! No need for fresh here; and</li>
      <li>
        Coriander/cilantro – Stirred into the potato filling at the end, it adds
        such a great hit of freshness.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How to make Samosas</h2>
    <ol>
      <p>The four parts to making Samosas are:</p>
      <li>The spiced potato filling;</li>
      <li>The Samosa dough;</li>
      <li>Making the Samosa parcels; and</li>
      <li>
        Frying – Sorry, there is no alternative! Do not try to bake them, you
        will be sorely disappointed!
      </li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
      <h3>PART 1: SPICED POTATO FILLING</h3>
      <p>
        The filling for Samosas is typically vegetarian, made with roughly
        mashed potato that’s cooked up with spices, fresh green chilli and peas.
        Altthough you’ll see plenty of versions with meat (usually ground), I
        like to keep things traditional – regular readers know I don’t say that
        often!😂
      </p>
      <li>
        Rough-mashed potato – Boil potatoes until tender, then use a fork to
        roughly mash. It’s nice to have bits of chunks in the potato for
        interest, rather than a soft, creamy and uniform mash;
      </li>
      <li>
        Cook spices and aromatics – A healthy dose of spices are fried up with
        fresh ginger and chilli which is then tossed through along the peas;
      </li>
      <li>
        Add potato – Add the mashed potato and gently but thoroughly mix
        through, so the flavouring fully permeates the potato; and
      </li>
      <li>
        Fresh coriander, then cool – Lastly, mix through fresh coriander, then
        let the filling cool completely before using.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <ol>
      <h3>PART 2: SAMOSA DOUGH</h3>
      <p>
        A key feature of the Samosa pastry is how flaky it is. This is achieved
        by rubbing ghee or oil into the flour until it resembles breadcrumbs,
        just like we do with Western shortcrust pastry!
      </p>
      <li>
        Mix dry ingredients, add ghee – Mix the flour, Ajwain seeds and salt,
        then pour the ghee or oil in;
      </li>
      <li>
        Rub fat in – Use your fingers to rub the ghee in until it resembles
        coarse breadcrumbs. This is the step that gives the Samosa pastry the
        signature flakiness we know and love so much!
      </li>
      <li>
        Form dough, rest 30 minutes – We then add water until it is wet enough
        to form a dough. The dough should be soft and pliable, but not so sticky
        that it sticks to your hands. Form a ball and let it rest for 30
        minutes;
      </li>
      <li>Divide – Form a log, then cut into 6 equal pieces;</li>
      <li>Shape dough into balls;</li>
      <li>
        Roll out balls to 2mm thick – Roll the dough balls into discs 2mm thick.
        They should be about 16cm /6.5” in diameter.
      </li>
      <p>Now, you’re ready to make the little Samosa parcels!</p>
    </ol>
    <ol>
      <h3>PART 3: SAMOSA PARCELS</h3>
      <p>
        Don’t get stressed out about this part. It’s honestly not that hard. And
        if yours are a bit deformed and wonky, so what? It’s still going to
        taste amazing!!! And you can just say they’re “rustic”. 😉
      </p>
      <li>
        Cut in half – Use a small knife to cut a circle in half. Work with one
        disc of dough at a time. Keep the others covered under cling wrap so
        they don’t dry out;
      </li>
      <li>Brush disc with water along half the straight edge you just cut;</li>
      <li>Fold one side in;</li>
      <li>
        Form cone – Then fold the other side in, overlapping by about 1cm /
        2/5″, to form a cone shape. Press joined edges together to secure;
      </li>
      <li>
        Fill cone – Form an “O” with your thumb and forefinger, then place the
        cone inside (like at the holders at the ice cream shop). Fill with the
        spiced potato filling;
      </li>
      <li>Brush with water along the cone mouth edge;</li>
      <li>Seal – Press to seal;</li>
      <li>
        Fold seam side down – Place the seam side down on the work surface so it
        folds over;
      </li>
      <li>Trim excess pastry off;</li>
      <li>Pinch top of cone to make it nice and pointy;</li>
      <li>Fold in the other two corners;</li>
      <li>Voila! You’re done!</li>
    </ol>
    <ol>
      <h3>
        PART 4: FRYING – AND THE TRICK TO LESS GREASY, ULTRA-CRISPY SAMOSAS!
      </h3>
      <p>
        The trick to frying Samosas is to start on low heat, otherwise the
        pastry can burst open and the filling spills out into the hot oil!
      </p>
      <p>
        Consequently, most recipes will call for the Samosas to be fried at a
        relatively low temperature of 160°C/320°F for 10 minutes+. But this
        makes them SUPER-greasy!
      </p>
      <p>
        Instead, we’re using the good old, reliable Asian double-fry method.
        It’s fast becoming the world’s worst-kept cooking secret for less
        greasy, ultra-crispy fried goods, it’s used in takeout favourites from
        Honey Chicken to Sweet & Sour Pork, to Japanese Karaage. It involves an
        initial fry on low heat to seal, followed by a second fry on high heat
        to colour and crisp.
      </p>
      <li>
        First fry: Seal Pastry – Heat the oil to 160°C/320°F, then fry 3 or 4
        samosas for 3 minutes, turning occasionally. The pastry should be cooked
        but pale;
      </li>
      <li>
        Drain on paper towels then repeat this first fry with remaining samosas;
      </li>
      <li>
        Second fry: Colour and crisp – Once you’ve done the first fry with all
        the Samosas, increase the oil heat to 190°C/375°F. Then fry the Samosas
        in batches of 3 or 4 for around 1 1/2 to 2 minutes until golden. The
        Samosas are already cooked through, this step is just to colour and
        really crisp up that pastry;
      </li>
      <li>
        Drain on paper towels and serve piping hot for optimum eating
        experience!
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Dipping Sauce for Samosas</h3>
    <p>
      The recipe includes a Tamarind Dipping Sauce which is a popular condiment
      to serve alongside Samosas. The sauce is a bit tart, which nicely cuts
      through the rich flaky pastry and balances the spice infused filling.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a simpler option, you could just blitz up yogurt with fresh mint
      leaves for a quick Raita of sorts (Indian Mint Sauce).
    </p>
    <h3>How to serve Samosas</h3>
    <p>
      Samosas, like Pakoras, are typically served as a starter or snack, being
      the terrific hand-held size that they are. Though mind you, I’ve seen
      plenty of gigantic Samosas in my time. I can’t deal with the thought of
      the volume of oil required to fry those beasts! 😂
    </p>
    <p>
      I’m sharing this Samosa recipe as part of an Indian Week, so you can make
      your very own Indian feast! Just to recap, here’s what we’ve got on the
      menu:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Palak Paneer – The iconic Indian Spinach Curry with your very own
        homemade cheese curd (puts store bought to shame!);
      </li>
      <li>Naan – The softest, fluffiest, chewiest naan you will ever make!</li>
      <li>
        Indian Cabbage Salad – This one will surprise you, it’s so incredibly
        delicious; and
      </li>
      <li>Samosas – to kick start your party!</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      And with this Samosa recipe, that’s a wrap on Indian Week. I hope you’ve
      enjoyed the recipes as much as I have creating them … oh yes, and shooting
      them and filming them and making them over and over to check them … and
      DEVOURING them!! 😂
