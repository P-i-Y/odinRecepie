    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <li>
        <h4>Make Samosa Dough</h4>
        <ol>
            1. Start by making the samosa dough. To a large bowl, add flour, ajwain (carom seeds), salt and mix well.

        </ol>
        <ol>
            2. Add the oil and then start mixing with your fingers. Rub the flour with the oil until the oil is well incorporated in all of the flour. Do this for 3 to 4 minutes, you don't want to rush this step. Once incorporated,  the mixture resembles crumbs.
        </ol>
        <ol>
            3. Press some flour between your palm- it should form a shape (& not crumble) - means oil is enough and well incorporated.
        </ol>
        <ol>
            4. Now, start adding water, little by little and mix to form a stiff dough. Don't overwork the dough and don't knead a soft dough. It should just come together and form a stiff dough. I used around 6 tablespoons of water here.
        </ol>
        <ol>
            5. Cover the dough with a moist cloth and let it rest for 40 minutes. I usually soak a paper towel in water and then squeeze out all the water and then cover my dough with that. While the dough is resting, start working on the filling.
